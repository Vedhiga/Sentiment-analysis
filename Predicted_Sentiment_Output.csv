i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering advanced education should be concerned about democratization and the experience catch 22 i feel like your video alluded to what i mean by democratization quite well so i think were probably in agreement there a lot of programs focus on training people to understand the ins and outs of libraries like tensorflow pytorch and sklearn as well as how to mathematically derive and formally describe a bunch of models i think a lot of the implementation of those models is routine and boilerplate enough that its ripe for automation using some kind of automl the sqllike syntax that redshift and bigquery offer or some managed product that abstracts the implementation away this opens ml models up to the techsavy but nonspecialist employees who have a very firm grasp on the domain knowledge already pushing the roles that require deep technical expertise farther out to data engineering and mlops we still need people to hyperoptimize models and do core research for critical applications but often its just not business critical to hire full teams to read papers and install cutting edge deep learning models off of github all day for experience i really think theres a cruel pattern emerging of people investing enormous amounts of time and money toward masters programs and endless selfteaching motivated by the perception that the industry is starved for people this is where i think we disagree the job opening numbers you present are accurate but you dont talk about how that need is distributed with respect to years of experience the largest companies have well structured well funded teams that can afford to take on new grads that need training but a lot of companies are only interested if you have a proven track record and can convince them you can deliver value extremely quickly with little need for them to train or invest in you i would love to see a graph overlaying the number of candidates at each experience level over the number of jobs searching for people at that level my expectation is that youd see a massive gap favoring employers at 02 years of experience and a massive gap favoring employees at 5 years of experience so while the industry is expanding the companies arent hiring juniors or at least not at the rate you need to be optimistic coming out of an expensive not top tier masters program together i think these trends speak to a frightening future for the opportunities for new data science professionals if workers with domain experience but not a ds education can be hired directly into the junior roles given the democratization of the field and if education alone is insufficient to get you an entry level job i think were going to see a very desperate job market for people trying to get into the industry perhaps what will happen is that new grads will need to pick an industry and work a non data science job for long enough to gain years of domain experience but that can be a hard sell after spending enormous amounts of time and money on a new degree,positive,i agree that the fears of full automation and a fully saturated job market are overblown but at the same time i think theres a real pair of twin concerns that people considering

yo this video has gotten a lot more views than it deserves for being as dumb and badly put together as it was so i feel like i should clear a few things up first off to game devs who are just starting out dont attempt to do exactly what i did because it probably wont work out well and im not saying this because i think im smarter or better at game dev than you in all honesty im pretty average and tons of people couldve done a lot better in my shoes but thats just the thing not everyone is in my shoes and has the same experience that i had prior to this id been making 2d games and was quite familiar with coding so carrying that over to unity and 3 dimensions was fairly simple i mentioned this in the video but ive seen too many comments in the vein of wow this was impressive i would never be able to do this which frankly makes me feel a little bad since most people probably would be able to do this if they had the same experience i had and i dont want to discourage anyone who doesnt realize this so i just wanted to reiterate that this was just a video made for shits and giggles by a guy who already knew how to make 2d games and wanted to apply that knowledge to 3 dimensions also everyone learns at their own pace in their own way and the rate at which that gets done doesnt really matter as long as youre able to learn what you needed to learn in the end within reason of course if it takes 8 years to figure out how to print hello world then we might have a problem so even if you have as much experience as i did there should be no reason to feel bad if you take more time because ultimately it doesnt really matter how quickly youre able to learn how to make games as a game developer you develop games and the quality of those games is really the only thing you should be worrying about not how quickly you can make them of course this mostly only applies if youre doing this as a hobby and if you have a deadline to meet and bills to pay you should probably worry a little more and on the other side of the spectrum to those who think this video was faked it wasnt lol as mentioned before i already knew how to make 2d games and how to program things arguably the hardest part of developing games because of that the focus of this video wasnt on that but rather applying what i knew to 3d games by learning 3d modelling animation and how to work with unity which was fairly easy and straightforward thanks to the massive amounts of documentation and resources available on the internet and such but mostly this was just for shits and giggles since i find messing around with 3d games entertaining and i feel like people may be reading into it too much lol also there are a few continuity errors that a few people have caught in the dates shown on my computers taskbar but that was caused by how i usually record clips while video editing and not when im actually making the games so i just have a weird workflow and last thing to youtube why the fuck does this have 500000 views did the algorithm break i can think of a whole lot of videos that deserve 500000 views and this is definitely not one of them so if youre watching this go watch someone elses video

compared to the same time last year i feel like im living in the cloud 9 3 games 3 wins 9 points 9 goals scored with only 2 goals allowed can you believe that for ones like tierney tomiyasu and smith rowe who were main starters for arsenal last season we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by i hope they can be patient grab the opportunities and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on compared to the last season this is a huge improvement the squad depth is so much thicker that we are using tomiyasu smith rowe and tierney as substitutes hopefully next week i would like to see vieira to make a debut even if its just for 10 or 20 minutes,positive,compared to the same time last year i feel like im living in the cloud   games  wins  points  goals scored with only  goals allowed can you believe that for ones like tierney tomiyasu and smith rowe who were main starters for arsenal last season we will definitely need their contribution more as the season goes by i hope they can be patient grab the opportunities and show what they are capable of on the pitch as the season keep going on compared to the last season this is a huge improvement the squad depth is so much thicker that we are using tomiyasu smith rowe and tierney as substitutes hopefully next week i would like to see vieira to make a debut even if its just for  or  minutes,positive

thanks for sharing i am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to since sat scores are all relative since i score a 1500 it blows my mind to think about being in the top 99 i think the part about scores being inflated because schools dont have to report bad test scores since students arent submitting bad tests scores makes sense however i do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the us world news report requires a school to report at least 50 of its students scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings thus more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots,positive,thanks for sharing i am really glad you put this video in the context of what schools the student is looking to apply to since sat scores are all relative since i score a  it blows my mind to think about being in the top  i think the part about scores being inflated because schools dont have to report bad test scores since students arent submitting bad tests scores makes sense however i do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the us world news report requires a school to report at least  of its students scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings thus more elite schools will take more students with scores than without to maintain their coveted spots,positive

ideas building a second brain can help you express your creativity be more productive and make better decisions every job today involves knowledge work of some kind and a second brain can help you

capturing information both manually and automatically ali captures his thoughts and ideas in apple notes he also has a system for automatically capturing highlights from books articles and podcasts having a good capture system helps reduce stress levels by freeing up your brain from having to remember everything ali recommends using a note taking system to store thoughts and ideas that come to mind throughout the day as well as highlights from books articles and podcasts 0832 o organise ali suggests organizing information by actionability rather than topic in order to be more targeted and efficient in ones learning this means that when you come across something relevant you add it to the project folder related to the action you plan to take rather than creating a new category for it you can still search for specific information using control f or command f if needed this system is especially helpful when working on longterm projects with many moving parts 1107 d distill ali talks about a method called progressive summarization which is basically like highlighting but on steroids this is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important different than highlighting were used to in school its not particularly effective for retention in your own personal brain but it is effective for flagging up the areas which are particularly important 1145 e express the e in the second brain system stands for express meaning that once you have captured and organized your ideas you need to share them with the world in some way sharing your ideas allows you to receive feedback collaborate with others and ultimately create something tangible that is the output of all of your hard work without expressing our ideas they are essentially useless its important to find a way to share your creativity with others 1309 how my second brain has helped ali the coursebook has helped ali become more productive but also more creative and less stressed in general the

some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such people lack an understanding of what evolution is and how it works apparently someone told such people that humans evolved from apes and from that due to their lack of education they assumed that all apes were supposed to evolve into humans that is not how evolution works but creationists have no interest in learning anything other than creation mythology they might just as well have asked if dogs are descended from wolves why are there still wolves or even if americans came from europe why are there still europeans just as dogs descended from a population of wolves so too did humans evolve from one particular population of apes what we know is that the first apes evolved in africa about 25 million years ago from a population of old world monkeys whereas monkeys run on all four feet across the tops of branches apes evolved the ability to swing arm over arm from branch to branch evolution works to make each species best suited to their environment for apes that environment was the forest and they are well suited for it at one time there were about 30 different species of apes in those forests had environmental conditions remained the same we would still see forests covering the whole african continent however conditions did not stay the same the climate became drier as a result forested areas shrank in size and were replaced by grasslands the african savanna with just a few scattered trees the shrinking forests put different ape species in competition with each other and many went extinct then about 6 or 7 million years ago one population of apes split with some of them opting for life on that open savanna all apes are capable of walking upright they are just not comfortable doing so for long periods of time recent experiments with trained chimps on a treadmill have shown that for them walking upright was more efficient in terms of energy expended than quadrupedal walking chimps and other apes though must shift their weight from side to side while walking bipedaly that savanna environment favored skeletal changes that placed the knees directly under the center of gravity by about 4 mya our ancestral australopithecines had almost the same pelvis femur knees and feet as modern humans that gave them a smooth stride that was efficient for long distance travel they did however retain long arms and curved fingers enabling them to climb a tree when danger threatened the apes that remained in a forest environment were under little pressure to change they became the ancestors of todays chimps and bonobos those living in the open were presented challenges not experienced by woodland apes and that required greater intelligence and cooperation to overcome them it set their descendants on a different evolutionary trajectory that culminated in us,negative,some people still ask why are there still apes or monkeys it should be obvious that such
